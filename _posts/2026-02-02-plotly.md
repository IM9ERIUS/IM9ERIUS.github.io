Hello everyone and Happy new Year!

It has been some time since the creation of this following Github page and I would like to take the time to detail my goals for the 2026.

By the end of this year I intend to complete the Security+ exam, complete a personal project of creating a Honey Pot from start to finish as well as 

continuing to detail walkthroughs of Blue Team HTB Sherlocks. Everyday brings new concepts and challenges and I am excited to keep learning and developing my skills.

Updates to come!
